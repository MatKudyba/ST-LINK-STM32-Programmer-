# ST-LINK-STM32-Programmer-
This is the first completed project while learning Altium Designer. This board is a prototype of the ST-Link programmer, which is required for programming STM32 microcontrollers. The PCB design has 4 layers and the board size is compact like a standard flash drive. There are project files on Altium Designer as well as standard GBR files in the zip file.
